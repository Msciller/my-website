		<h1>INTERNET ASPECTS</h1>
		<h2>Internet Security</h2>
			<p>The active and passive attacks both fall in the family of security attacks, with a few underlying points that differentiate them. Security attacks are typically computer attacks that jeopardize the security of the system. These security attacks are further classified into active attacks and passive attacks, where the hacker gets unlawful access to the system’s recourses.

		<h4>What is active attack?</h4>
			<p>Active attacks are attacks in which the hacker attempts to change or transform the content of messages or information. These attacks are a threat to the integrity and availability of the system. Due to these attacks, systems get damaged, and information can be altered. The prevention of these attacks is difficult due to their high range of physical and software vulnerabilities.
			The damage that is done with these attacks can be very harmful to the system and its resources.
			<br>
			<br>
			The good thing about this type of attack is that the victim is notified about the attack. So, instead of prevention, the paramount importance is laid on detecting the attack and restoration of the system from the attack. An active attack typically requires more effort and generally have more difficult implication. Some protective measures that can be taken against this kind of attack are:
			<br>
			<br>
			Making use of one time passwords helps in authenticating the transactions between two parties. 
			<br>
			A random session key can be generated, which will be valid for only one transaction. This will help in preventing the attacker from retransmitting the original information after the actual session ends. 
			</p>
		<h4>What is passive attack?</h4>
			<p>Passive attacks are the ones in which the attacker observes all the messages and copy the content of messages or information. They focus on monitoring all the transmission and gaining the data. The attacker does not try to change any data or information he gathered. 
			Although there is no potential harm to the system due to these attacks, they can be a significant danger to your data’s confidentiality. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Unlike the Active attacks, these are difficult to detect as it does not involve alteration in data or information. Thus, the victim doesn’t get any idea about the attack. Although it can be prevented using some encryption techniques. In this way, at any time of transmission, the message is in indecipherable form, so that hacker could not understand it. So this is the reason why more emphasis is given to prevention than detection. There are some protective measures that you can take to prevent these attacks.
			<br>
			<br>
			Avoid posting sensitive and personal information online as attackers can use it to hack your network.
			<br>
			Use the encryption method for your messages and make them unreadable for any unintended intruder.
			</p>
		<h3>Difference between them</h3>
			<p>Although both active and passive attacks are a part of security attacks, if you compare active and passive attacks, both of them have a lot of differences between them. The main differences between them are made based on how they are done and how much damage they do to the system and its resources. Difference between active and passive attacks in network security are listed down below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In active attacks, modification of messages is done, but on the other hand, in passive attacks, the information remains unchanged.</li>
					<li>The active attack causes damage to the integrity and availability of the system, but passive attacks cause damage to data confidentiality. </li>
					<li>In active attacks, attention is given to detection, while in the other one, attention is given to prevention. </li>
					<li>The resources can be changed in active attacks, but passive attacks have no impact on the resources.</li>
					<li>The active attack influences the system services, but the information or data is acquired in passive attacks.</li>
					<li>In active attacks, information is gathered through passive attacks to attack the system, while passive attacks are achieved by collecting confidential information such as private chats and passwords. </li>
					<li>Active attacks are challenging to be prohibited, but passive attacks are easy to prevent. </li>
				</ul>
		<h2>Malware</h2>
			<p>Malware, short for malicious software, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. 
			As Microsoft puts it, "[malware] is a catch-all term to refer to any software designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network." In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it.
			<br>
			<br>
			This means that the question of, say, what the difference is between malware and a virus misses the point a bit: a virus is a type of malware, so all viruses are malware (but not every piece of malware is a virus).
			</p>
		<h4>Types of malware</h4>
			<p>There are a number of different ways of categorizing malware; the first is by how the malicious software spreads. You've probably heard the words virus, trojan, and worm used interchangeably, but as Symantec explains, they describe three subtly different ways malware can infect target computers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A<strong>worm</strong> is a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.</li>
					<li>A<strong>trojan</strong>is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.</li>
					<li>A<strong>virus</strong> is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Malware can also be installed on a computer "manually" by the attackers themselves, either by gaining physical access to the computer or using privilege escalation to gain remote administrator access. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Another way to categorize malware is by what it does once it has successfully infected its victim's computers. There are a wide range of potential attack techniques used by malware:
