		<h1>DIGITAL SIGNATURE</h1>
			<p>A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very strong reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).
			<br>
			<br>
			Digital signatures are a standard element of most cryptographic protocol suites, and are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, contract management software, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering.
			<br>
			<br>
			Digital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, which includes any electronic data that carries the intent of a signature, but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures. In some countries, including Canada, South Africa, the United States, Algeria, Turkey, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Chile and the countries of the European Union, electronic signatures have legal significance.

		<h2>How to sign documents with the eID Card <em>(DNIe)</em></h2>
			<p>We all have in our wallet or pocket a powerful tool to sign legally, securely and legaly electronic documents. You only need to take a look at your ID card, you may not be aware of some of the possible uses it offers, so we bring them to you here.
			<br>
			Personal identity recognition has evolved thanks to technological growth in society. In the case of Spain, the ID card was created in 1951, and its use has gradually been made compulsory for people over 14 years of age.
			<br>
			<br>
			Nowadays, the Identity Card or DNI is valid for many things more than just for verifying our data in front of the Authorities and Administrations. This is due to the implementation of measures such as the e-signatures.
			<br>	
			</p>
		<h3>How to sign with the DNIe (eID)?</h3>
			<p>When we talk about electronic signature through DNIe or the DNI 3.0, we use the term qualified electronic signature. This type of signature offers the highest legal guarantees, with the same level of recognition as the handwritten signature, and defined by eIDAS Regulation as:
			<br>
			<em>‘’A qualified electronic signature is an advanced electronic signature with a qualified digital certificate that has been created by a qualified signature creation device (QSCD)’’.</em>
			</p>
		<h4>1.- Complying with the requirements to sign with the DNIe (eID)</h4>
			<p>First of all, we will have to check whether we meet the minimum technical requirements for hardware and software for its use. In the case of the eID, it will be mandatory to have a smart card reader, which can be integrated into the keyboard or connected to the computer via USB or PCMCIA card.
			<br>
			DNI 3.0 allows the possibility to sign electronically via NFC, in which the device must comply with ISO 14443 Standard regarding e-identification cards, especially proximity cards.
			<br>
			<br>
			Regarding software, both DNIe and DNI 3.0 are ready to be used in any operating system, such as:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer (6.0 or later)</li>
					<li>Mozilla Firefox (1.5 or later)</li>
					<li>Netscape (4.78 or later)</li>
				</ul>	
			<p>If we are going to sign using a smart card reader, we will need to have both cryptographic modules (which varies depending on the operating system or browser) and drivers of the reading device.</p>
		<h4>2.- Sign electronically from the App</h4>
			<p>In order to sign, we must open the document to be signed via our software solution.
			<br>
			The process for signing step by step will vary depending on the tool we will be using. In the case of Viafirma, this is a very simple and intuitive procedure. Whether using a card reader or NFC, the solution will recognize the certificate as any other in the operating system. You only need to select the certificate and use it.
			<br>
			<br>
			Generally speaking, you will first need to select the document, which can be viewed prior to signing, to then sign it, which will require the verification PIN of our DNIe or DNI 3.0. This code is provided to us when we receive the PIN and we can change it if we want to.
			<br>
			Therefore, as we can see, getting the most out of the DNIe and DNI 3.0 only requires a few simple steps that can be done from practically any device or operating system.

			<br>
			<br>
			In any case, this is a way to gain time, comfort and legal support for all citizens who have access to administrative procedures, as well as the option of signing documents digitally with the help of a specialized software, such as the one offered by Viafirma.
