		<h1>Guidelines on accessible web design</h1>
		<h3>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h3>
		<p>In 1999 the Web Accessibility Initiative, a project by the World Wide Web
		Consortium (W3C), published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 1.0.
		On 11 December 2008, the WAI released the WCAG 2.0 as a Recommendation. WCAG
		2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral. Though web designers can choose
		either standard to follow, the WCAG 2.0 have been widely accepted as the definitive
		guidelines on how to create accessible websites. Governments are steadily adopting the
		WCAG 2.0 as the accessibility standard for their own websites.</p>
		<h2>WCAG 1.0</h2>
        	<p>The WCAG 1.0 was published and became a W3C recommendation on 5 May 1999. They
		have since been superseded by WCAG 2.0.<br>
		WCAG 1.0 consists of 14 guidelines—each of which describes a general principle of
		accessible design. Each guideline covers a basic theme of web accessibility and is
		associated with one or more checkpoints that describe how to apply that guideline to
		particular webpage features.<br></p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Guideline 1:</strong> Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 2:</strong> Don’t rely on colour alone</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 3:</strong> Use markup and style sheets, and do so properly</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 4:</strong> Clarify natural language usage</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 5:</strong> Create tables that transform gracefully</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 6:</strong> Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 7:</strong> Ensure user control of time sensitive content changes</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 8:</strong> Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 9:</strong> Design for device independence</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 10:</strong> User interim solutions</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 11:</strong> Use W3C technologies and guidelines</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 12:</strong> Provide context and orientation information</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 13:</strong> Provide clear navigation mechanisms</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 14:</strong> Ensure that documents are clear and simple</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each of the in total 65 WCAG 1.0 checkpoints has an assigned priority level based on the
		checkpoint's impact on accessibility:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Web developers must satisfy these requirements, otherwise it will be
		impossible for one or more groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this
		level is described as A</li>
		<li><strong>Priority 2:</strong> Web developers should satisfy these requirements, otherwise some
		groups will find it difficult to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is
		described as AA or Double-A.</li>
		<li><strong>Priority 3:</strong> Web developers may satisfy these requirements to make it easier for
		some groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described
		as AAA or Triple-A.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>WCAG Samurai</h3>
		<p>In February 2008, The WCAG Samurai, a group of developers independent of the W3C,
		published corrections for, and extensions to, the WCAG 1.0.</p>
		<h2>WCAG 2.0</h2>
		<p>WCAG 2.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on 11 December 2008. It consists of
		twelve guidelines (untestable) organized under four principles (websites must
		be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust). Each guideline has testable
		success criteria (61 in all). The W3C's Techniques for WCAG 2.0 is a list of techniques that
		support authors to meet the guidelines and success criteria. The techniques are
		periodically updated whereas the principles, guidelines and success criteria are stable and
		do not change.</p>
		<h3>Principles</h3>
		<h4>Perceivable</h4>
		<p>Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can
		perceive.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Guideline 1.1:</strong> Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be
		changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or
		simpler language.</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 1.2:</strong> Time-based media: Provide alternatives for time-based media.</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 1.3:</strong> Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example
		simpler layout) without losing information or structure.</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 1.4:</strong> Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating
		foreground from background.</li>
		</ul>		
		<h4>Operable</h4>
		<p>User interface components and navigation must be operable.</p>
		<ul>
		<li<strong>Guideline 2.1:</strong> Make all functionality available from a keyboard.</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 2.2:</strong> Provide users enough time to read and use content.</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 2.3:</strong> Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 2.4:</strong> Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine
		where they are.</li>
		</ul>		
		<h4>Understandable</h4>
		<p>Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Guideline 3.1:</strong> Make text content readable and understandable.</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 3.2:</strong> Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.</li>
		<li><strong>Guideline 3.3:</strong> Help users avoid and correct mistakes.</li>
		</ul>		
		<h4>Robust</h4>
		<p>Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user
		agents, including assistive technologies.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Guideline 4.1.:</strong> Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including
		assistive technologies.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>WCAG 2.0 uses the same three levels of conformance (A, AA, AAA) as WCAG 1.0, but has
		redefined them. The WCAG working group maintains an extensive list of web accessibility
		techniques and common failure cases for WCAG 2.0.</p>		
		<h4>Criticism of WAI guidelines</h4>
		<p>There has been criticism of the W3C process, claiming that it does not sufficiently put the
		user at the heart of the process. There was a formal objection to WCAG's original claim that
		WCAG 2.0 will address requirements for people with learning disabilities and cognitive
		limitations headed by Lisa Seeman and signed by 40 organisations and people. In articles
		such as "WCAG 2.0: The new W3C guidelines evaluated", "To Hell with WCAG 2.0" and
		"Testability Costs Too Much", the WAI has been criticised for allowing WCAG 1.0 to get
		increasingly out of step with today's technologies and techniques for creating and
		consuming web content, for the slow pace of development of WCAG 2.0, for making the
		new guidelines difficult to navigate and understand, and other argued failings.<br>
		In Spain, UNE 139803 is the norm entrusted to regulate web accessibility. This standard is
		based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.</p>
